Component List
Microcontroller Unit (MCU)
For handling the main control logic, sensor data processing, and communication.

Motor
Used to physically adjust the radiator valve.

Motor Driver
Interfaces between the microcontroller and the motor, providing the required current and control signals.

Temperature Sensor
Measures the current room or radiator temperature for decision-making.

Wireless Communication Module
Enables communication between the thermostat and the remote control (e.g., LoRa or other low-power wireless tech).

Display Module
Allows users to view current temperature, target values, or status information.

User Interface Buttons
For adjusting the target temperature, navigating menu options, or confirming selections.

Power Supply/Battery
Provides power to the entire system, including motor, sensor, and microcontroller.

PCB or Breadboard
Used to wire and connect components in a structured and stable manner.

Connectors, Cables, and Sockets
For wiring and connecting components securely.

Case
Encloses the electronics and mechanical parts, allowing mounting to the radiator and protection of internal parts.

Fasteners and Mounting Hardware
Screws, bolts, and spacers used to assemble and mount the components inside the housing.
