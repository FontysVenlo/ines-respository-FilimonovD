This sprint went well overall. On the software side, there were no big problems, but it did take some time to get everything working as expected. Once things were in place, the components fit in smoothly with the rest of the system.

The hardware side was a bit more challenging. Since we're still getting used to soldering, making reliable connections wasn't easy at first. That caused some delays and extra troubleshooting, but we managed to sort it out in the end.

All in all, the sprint helped us improve both technically and as a team. The hardware work, especially, showed us where we still have room to grow.
